#### Project was made based on my classroom exercices

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Data Structure Tree (Binary tree, and Expression tree) </h1>
 A simple project about Data Structure and Algorithms.
 
## What I use?

Only python
    

## What I do?

Steps:
  <ul>
    <li>I trying to add a data on code making a binary tree (Was made).</li>
    <li>Now im trying to add a expression tree, i will give a full expression and code will interpret it, and make a expression tree (Was made, but code only recognize pair number of expressions, and with specified numbers and operator, later i will made it interactive)</li>
    <li>Made it Interactive, independent of operators and numbers</li>
    <li>Continue mading it Interactive, recognize sub-expressions (broke a expression in minor parts) in a fully expression</li>
  </ul>
