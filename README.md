#### Project was made based on my classroom exercices

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Data Structure Tree (Binary tree, and Expression tree) </h1>
 A project about Data Structure (tree model) and Algorithms.
 
## What I use?

Only python
    

## What I do (and will do)?

Steps:
  <ul>
    <li>I trying to add a data on code making a binary tree (Was made).</li>
    <li>Now im trying to add a expression tree, i will give a full expression and code will interpret it, and make a expression tree (Was made, but code only recognize pair number of expressions, and with specified numbers and operator, later i will made it interactive)</li>
    <li>Made it Interactive, independent of operators and numbers</li>
    <li>Continue coding it Interactive, recognize sub-expressions (broke a expression in minor parts) in a fully expression</li>
      <ul>
        <li>To made it, i have a idea to give a expression splited by brackets, and try to force the code in recognize this brackets and broke the expressions in small expressions</li>
        <li>Ex.:</li>
          <ul>
          <li>A expression -> [3 * 5] + 4 - [8 - 8], on code will be recognize how X = '3 * 5', Z = 'X + 4 - Y' and Y = '8 - 8' </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
  </ul>
